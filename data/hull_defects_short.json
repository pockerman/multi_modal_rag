		{
			"q": "what is fiberglass delamination?",
			"a": "Fiberglass delamination is the separation of layers within a fiberglass structure, where the fiberglass cloth and resin, or the resin and the core material in a sandwich construction, lose their bond.\n This separation weakens the structural integrity of the material and can occur due to moisture intrusion, poor manufacturing techniques, physical impact, or prolonged exposure to environmental stressors like UV radiation and temperature fluctuations.\n Water is a leading cause, as it can penetrate cracks or unsealed seams, dissolve adhesives, and lead to the layers detaching from one another.\n Delamination can be detected through methods like tapping the surface with a plastic mallet—healthy laminate produces a sharp sound, while delaminated areas produce a dull thud—and by feeling for soft spots, especially on horizontal surfaces like decks."
